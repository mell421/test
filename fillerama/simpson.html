<p>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?</p>
<p>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. <strong>That's the American way.</strong> <em>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog.</em> Actually, replace &quot;accidentally&quot; with &quot;repeatedly&quot; and replace &quot;dog&quot; with &quot;son.</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-win-friends-with-salad">You don't win friends with salad.</h2>
<p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</p>
<ol>
<li>Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</li>
<li>A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</li>
<li>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &quot;Smoke Yourself Thin&quot; and &quot;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="attempted-murder-now-honestly-what-is-that-do-they-give-a-nobel-prize-for-attempted-chemistry">Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?</h3>
<p>Human contact: the final frontier. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &quot;Smoke Yourself Thin&quot; and &quot;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&quot; I hope I didn't brain my damage. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.</li>
<li>Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.</li>
<li>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't get rich by signing checks. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. Ahoy hoy?</p>
<p>I hope I didn't brain my damage. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</p>
<p>Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
<p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!</p>
<p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three &quot;Highlander&quot; movies. Uh, no, they're saying &quot;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&quot;</p>
<p>Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! I didn't get rich by signing checks. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</p>
<p>Me fail English? That's unpossible. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. Me fail English? That's unpossible. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace &quot;accidentally&quot; with &quot;repeatedly&quot; and replace &quot;dog&quot; with &quot;son.&quot;</p>
<p>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>
<p>Thank you, steal again. I was saying &quot;Boo-urns.&quot; Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
