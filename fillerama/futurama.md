# You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

Look, last night was a mistake. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Is that a cooking show? __Meh.__ *My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution.* Also dark wizards.

## Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. And until then, I can never die?

1. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!
2. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
3. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.

### No, she'll probably make me do it.

Bender, quit destroying the universe! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

* Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
* So, how 'bout them Knicks?
* Bender, you risked your life to save me!

Then we'll go with that data file! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Hey, whatcha watching? Can I use the gun? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

We're also Santa Claus! I don't want to be rescued. You guys go on without me! I'm going to goâ€¦ look for more stuff to steal! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Guess again. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Why would I want to know that?

Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Ooh, name it after me! No! Don't jump! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.

And until then, I can never die? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Why would a robot need to drink?

Ow, my spirit! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Hey, whatcha watching? Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

Bender, quit destroying the universe! Pansy. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. No, I'm Santa Claus! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
